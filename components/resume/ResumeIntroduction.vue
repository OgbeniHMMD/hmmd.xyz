      <p>
        I enjoy building well detailed, state-of-the-art, easy to use,
        user-friendly websites and applications usually with the JAMstack. I.e,
        Javascript (Vanilla JS, Vue.js, React.js), the markup languages and/or
        the CSS frameworks (Bootstrap, Vuetify, TailwindCSS), and some
        Everything-as-a-Service (Xaas) solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have histories with ASP.NET/VB.NET, Java(SE), Python, PHP (Code
        Igniter, Laravel), Wordpress...
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't crumble under pressure, and I'm ever willing to learn new
        technologies.
